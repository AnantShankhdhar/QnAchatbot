sexual activity, vaccine effectiveness will be lower in older age groups because of prior infections. Exposure to HPV decreases among older age groups. Evidence sug -

Children and adults aged 9 through 26 years.  HPV vac-

US Department of Health and Human Services/Centers for Disease Control and PreventionSummary
What is already known about this topic?
Vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) is routinely 
recommended at age 11 or 12 years. Catch-up recommenda-tions apply to persons not vaccinated at age 11 or 12 years.
What is added by this report?
After reviewing new evidence, CDC updated HPV vaccination 
recommendations for U.S. adults.
What are the implications for public health practice?
Routine recommendations for HPV vaccination of adolescents 
have not changed. Catch-up HPV vaccination is now recom-mended for all persons through age 26 years. For adults aged 27 through 45 years, public health benefit of HPV vaccination in 
this age range is minimal; shared clinical decision-making is 
recommended because some persons who are not adequately vaccinated might benefit.
vaccination should be delayed until after pregnancy; however, 
pregnancy testing is not needed before vaccination. 
Recommendations regarding HPV vaccination during 
pregnancy or lactation have not changed (1).
Future Research and Monitoring Priorities
CDC continues to monitor safety of HPV vaccines and impact 
of the vaccination program on HPV-attributable outcomes, including prevalences of HPV infections, anogenital warts, 
cervical precancers, and cancers.

was found to be noninferior with 2 doses in persons aged 9 through 14 years compared with 3 doses in a group in which clinical efficacy was demonstrated (GRADE evidence type 3).
Efficacy and effectiveness.  Although efficacy and postlicen -
sure effectiveness studies were reviewed, none met the inclusion criteria detailed above. A large study comparing 
2 doses with 3 doses also suggested similar efficacy against infection (11). Postlicensure effectiveness studies have found lower effectiveness against various HPV-associated outcomes among vaccinees who received 2 doses compared with those who received 3 doses, but methodologic challenges with these 
studies limit interpretation of the findings.**
Duration of protection.  Through 10 years of follow-up 
from clinical trials, no evidence of waning protection after 
a 3-dose series of HPV vaccine has been found ( 1). Because 
antibody kinetics are similar with 2-dose and 3-dose series, duration of protection is also expected to be long-lasting after 
a 2-dose series (12,13).

and 3-dose schedules of 9vHPV in the United States have been modeled ( 14). Assuming both efficacy and duration of protec -

COPD is an important contributor to both mortality and 
disability in the United States ( 1,2). COPD is the primary 
contributor (>95%) to deaths from chronic lower respiratory 
diseases, the third leading cause of death in the United States 
(1). Among diseases and injuries, COPD also is the sixth 
largest contributor to number of years lived with disability in the United States ( 2). COPD is costly, with COPD-related 
medical costs estimated at $32 billion in the United States in 
2010 and an additional $4 billion in absenteeism costs (6). 
Persons with COPD are less likely to be employed and more likely to be limited in the type of work they can do compared with persons without COPD (7).In this study, adults with COPD were more likely to report 
activity limitations and being unable to work compared with adults without COPD. COPD has been found to be associated with a lower likelihood of employment, comparable with that for stroke and greater than that associated with heart disease or hypertension ( 8).

testing. Autopsy specimens were obtained from one decedent. At the time of specimen collection, clinical and demographic information was gathered about each affected patient (Table). Specimens were sent to the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory 
(NPHL) initially, and then to CDC. At CDC, multiplex, 
real-time PCR testing was performed for M. pneumoniae, 
Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella  species, and human 
nucleic acid (as a control) (1).
After the likely etiologic agent was identified as M. pneumoniae , 
the case definition was modified. A probable case was defined 
as an acute respiratory illness and either a fever ≥100.4°F 
(≥38.0°C) or a pneumonia diagnosed by radiograph in a person with an epidemiologic link (i.e., resident, staff member, staff family member, or visitor). A confirmed case was defined as illness meeting the probable case definition plus a PCR test Mycoplasma pneumoniae Outbreak in a Long-Term Care Facility —

Older patients with pneumonia might have falls, confusion, 
dizziness, or fatigue, without a fever or other classic pneumo-nia symptom, or they might have serious comorbidities (e.g., underlying lung disease), making case ascertainment difficult (2,3,5). This outbreak began in the Alzheimer unit, where accu -
rate illness histories could not be obtained and where certain patients were receiving nonaggressive care (e.g., patients might 
not be tested to determine the cause of an illness or receive interventions beyond those needed for comfort). These factors are common to outbreaks among older persons ( 3) and resulted in clinicians deferring diagnostic 
testing early in the outbreak. Certain patients, including the index patient, were treated with antibiotics ineffective against 
M. pneumoniae infection. After the outbreak’s etiology was 
confirmed, clinicians frequently prescribed antibiotics on the basis of nursing reports of a fever or cough rather than on patient evaluation or diagnostic test results. As a result, some probable cases might not have been M. pneumoniae infection, 
and certain cases might not have been identified because they 
did not meet the case definition, particularly those in persons who did not have fever.
Negative PCR results in some probable cases might be attrib -
utable to the timing of sampling, the difficulty in obtaining NP samples from certain patients, and the circulation at the time 
of the outbreak of other respiratory viruses that cause similar 
symptoms. M. pneumoniae  was not suspected early in this 
outbreak, which highlights the need at extended care facilities for prompt recognition and reporting of outbreaks, diagnostic evaluation and testing, and implementation of timely and strict 
infection control measures to prevent morbidity and mortality.What is already known on this topic?

rate illness histories could not be obtained and where certain patients were receiving nonaggressive care (e.g., patients might 
not be tested to determine the cause of an illness or receive interventions beyond those needed for comfort). These factors are common to outbreaks among older persons ( 3) and resulted in clinicians deferring diagnostic 
testing early in the outbreak. Certain patients, including the index patient, were treated with antibiotics ineffective against 
M. pneumoniae infection. After the outbreak’s etiology was 
confirmed, clinicians frequently prescribed antibiotics on the basis of nursing reports of a fever or cough rather than on patient evaluation or diagnostic test results. As a result, some probable cases might not have been M. pneumoniae infection, 
and certain cases might not have been identified because they 
did not meet the case definition, particularly those in persons who did not have fever.
Negative PCR results in some probable cases might be attrib -
utable to the timing of sampling, the difficulty in obtaining NP samples from certain patients, and the circulation at the time 
of the outbreak of other respiratory viruses that cause similar 
symptoms. M. pneumoniae  was not suspected early in this 
outbreak, which highlights the need at extended care facilities for prompt recognition and reporting of outbreaks, diagnostic evaluation and testing, and implementation of timely and strict

Introduction of 9vHPV in both males and females was 
cost-saving when compared with 4vHPV for both sexes in a 
cost-effectiveness model that assumed 9vHPV cost $13 more 
per dose than 4vHPV. Cost-effectiveness ratios for 9vHPV 
remained favorable compared with 4vHPV (9vHPV was cost-saving in most scenarios, and the cost per quality-adjusted life year gained did not exceed $25,000 in any scenario) when varying assumptions about HPV natural history, cervical cancer screening, vaccine coverage, vaccine duration of protec -
tion, and health care costs, but were sensitive to 9vHPV cost assumptions (17). Because the additional five types in 9vHPV account for a higher proportion of HPV-associated cancers in females compared with males and cause cervical precancers, the additional protection from 9vHPV will mostly benefit females.
Recommendations for Use of HPV Vaccines
ACIP recommends that routine HPV vaccination be initi -
ated at age 11 or 12 years. Vaccination is also recommended for females aged 13 through 26 years and for males aged 13 through 21 years who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series ( 1). Males aged 22 
through 26 years may be vaccinated.
† Vaccination of females 
is recommended with 2vHPV, 4vHPV (as long as this for-mulation is available), or 9vHPV. Vaccination of males is 
recommended with 4vHPV (as long as this formulation is 
available) or 9vHPV.
2vHPV, 4vHPV, and 9vHPV all protect against HPV 16 
and 18, types that cause about 66% of cervical cancers and the majority of other HPV-attributable cancers in the United States (1,12). 9vHPV targets five additional cancer causing 
types, which account for about 15% of cervical cancers ( 12). 
4vHPV and 9vHPV also protect against HPV 6 and 11, types 
that cause anogenital warts.TABLE 2. Results of a Phase III efficacy trial comparing 9-valent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) with quadrivalent HPV vaccine

Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in children, 
adolescents and adults are developed by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP). ACIP is chartered as a federal advisory committee to provide expert external advice and guidance to the Director of CDC on use of vaccines and related agents for the control of vaccine-preventable diseases in the civilian population of the United States. Recommendations for routine use of vaccines in adults are harmonized with recommendations of AAFP , ACOG, and the American College of Physicians (ACP). ACIP recommendations adopted by the CDC Director become agency guidelines on the date published in MMWR. 1

Genital human papillomavirus (HPV) is the most common 
sexually transmitted infection in the United States; an 
estimated 14 million persons are newly infected every year (1). Although most infections cause no symptoms and are 
self-limited, persistent HPV infection can cause cervical cancer in women as well as other anogenital cancers, oropharyngeal cancer, and genital warts in men and women.More than 150 HPV types have been identified, including 
approximately 40 that infect the genital area ( 2,3). Genital 
HPV types are categorized according to their epidemiologic association with cervical cancer. ","Recommendations and ReportsMMWR  / August 29, 2014  / Vol . 5 1Introduction

One study found that HPV prevalence among women aged 18–25 years was 14.3% for those with one lifetime sex partner, 22.3% for those with two lifetime partners, and 31.5% for those with three or more lifetime partners ( 44).

The CIN2 lesions represent an intermediate group that includes lesions that could be grouped into either low- or high-grade lesions (69). In meta-analyses, HPV prevalence was 12% (HPV 16 accounting for 20%) in women with normal cytology, 52% (HPV 16 accounting for 23%) in those with equivocal cytology, and 76% and 85%, respectively, in those with LSIL and HSIL cytology. Among histological specimens, HPV prevalence increased from 73% among CIN1 lesions to 93% among CIN3 lesions (70).
On the basis of a combination of natural history studies and 
HPV molecular analyses, essentially all cervical cancers are thought to be attributable to HPV ( 57). A 2011 meta-analysis

33,160 HPV-associated cancers were diagnosed in the United States, including 20,589 (62%) among females and 12,571 (38%) among males. Approximately 26,900 new cancers at these body sites were attributable to HPV, including 17,600 (65%) among females and 9,300 (35%) among males. Cervical and oropharyngeal cancers were the most common with an estimated 10,400 cervical cancers and 9,000 oropharyngeal cancers (7,200 [80%] among men and 1,800 [20%] among women). Cervical cancer 
screening is based on exfoliated cytology (Pap test) with 
clinical HPV testing in appropriate settings (see Cervical Cancer Screening). Abnormalities detected in screening require follow-up, and diagnosis is based on histology of the tissue sample. Terminology for histologic outcomes of squamous precursor lesions is changing from grades 1–3 of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) to the same terminology that is used for cytological abnormalities: low- or high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL and HSIL, respectively) (69). HSIL is considered a cancer precursor that requires 
treatment whereas LSIL generally clears without treatment. Precursors of glandular or adenocarcinomas are designated adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS). These lesions are detected less readily by Pap test because of their endocervical location. AIS also is considered a cancer precursor that requires treatment. The CIN terminology continues to be used widely and conveys the spectrum of changes from those that are clearly low grade (CIN1) to those that are clearly high grade (CIN3).

Anal Precancers and Cancer
Anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN) grade 2/3 is recognized 
as a precursor of anal cancer, although the natural history of 
these lesions (i.e., rate of progression and regression) is less clear than for cervical disease ( 51). Worldwide, a meta-analysis 
reported HPV in 84% of anal cancers, but HPV prevalence was higher in AIN2/3 (94%) ( 77). In the United States, 91% 
of anal cancers have been found to be positive for HPV, with HPV 16 being the most common type detected (77%) (59).
Men who have sex with men (MSM) and persons who have 
HIV infection are at higher risk for anal precancer and cancer (29,78,79). Although the burden of anal cancer and precancers 
is substantial, data are insufficient to recommend routine anal cancer screening with anal cytology in HIV-infected persons or HIV-negative MSM ( 29,80). More evidence is 
needed concerning the natural history of anal intraepithelial neoplasia, the best screening methods and target populations, and safety and response to treatments before routine screening can be recommended ( 80). Some clinical centers perform anal 
cytology to screen for anal cancer among high-risk populations (e.g., HIV-infected persons and MSM), followed by high-resolution anoscopy for those with abnormal cytologic results. This increase could be attributable to true increases or more aggressive screening among MSM in certain areas of the country, facilitating diagnosis ( 81). Both 
long- and short-term trends indicate that invasive anal cancer has increased at a steady rate among both males and females and among persons in almost every racial/ethnic group ( 65,66).

HPV4 Safety
Prelicensure Trials
In prelicensure trials, HPV4 was evaluated for injection-site 
and systemic adverse events, new medical conditions reported during the follow-up period, and safety during pregnancy and lactation. Safety data on HPV4 are available from seven clinical trials and included 18,083 persons who received HPV4, aluminum-containing control (AAHS), or saline placebo (11). In both the female and male study populations aged 9–26 years with detailed safety data, a larger proportion reported injection-site adverse events in the group that received HPV4 compared with AAHS control or saline placebo groups. In all three groups, pain was the most common injection site adverse event (Table 7).
Systemic clinical adverse events were reported by a similar 
proportion of vaccine and control/placebo groups among both females and males. Headache was most common, reported by 28.2% of females who received HPV4 and 28.4% of those who received AAHS or saline placebo; among males, 12.3% of those who received HPV4 and 11.2% of those who received AAHS or saline placebo reported headache. Overall, 4.0%–4.9% of females and 2.8%–3.0% of males who received HPV4 reported a temperature ≥100
°F (≥38 °C) after the first, second, or third 
dose. The proportions of persons reporting a serious adverse event were similar in the vaccine and placebo groups, as were the types of serious adverse event reported. Vaccine-related serious adverse events occurred in <0.1% of persons. Across all clinical studies (29,323 participants), during the course of the trials, 21 deaths (0.1%) occurred among persons in HPV4 groups and 19 (0.1%) among persons in the control or placebo groups. None of the deaths was considered to be vaccine related (11).
Information was collected on new medical conditions that 
occurred during follow-up of up to 4 years for females and 3 years for males. Overall, among females aged 9–26 years, 2.3% in the HPV4 group and 2.3% in the AAHS control or placebo groups had conditions potentially indicative of autoimmune disorders. Among males aged 9–26 years, 1.5% in the HPV4 group and 1.5% in the AAHS control or placebo groups had conditions potentially indicative of autoimmune disorders. No statistically significant differences were found between vaccine and AAHS control/placebo recipients for the incidence of the conditions (11).

In the phase III efficacy trial, females were followed for a 
median of 47 months after the first vaccine dose ( 160). The 
longest follow-up from the HPV2 clinical trials is from the 
phase II trial; a subset of participants has been followed for up to 9.4 years after the first dose ( 166). Among the 437 participants 
evaluated, efficacy for prevention of HPV 16/18 12-month persistent infection was 100% (95% CI = 61.4–100). Further data on duration of protection will be available from follow-up of females in the phase III trial. In addition, adolescents who were vaccinated at age 10–15 years in an immunogenicity trial (see HPV2 Immunogenicity) are being followed as they become sexually active.

Economic Burden of HPV and 
Cost-Effectiveness of Vaccination in 
the United States
Before HPV vaccine introduction, the prevention and 
treatment of HPV-related disease imposed an estimated burden of $8 billion or more in direct costs in the United States each year ( 178). Of this, approximately $1 billion was 
for treatment of cancer, including $400 million for invasive cervical cancer and $300 million for oropharyngeal cancer. Approximately $200 million was for treatment of recurrent respiratory papillomatosis and $300 million was for treatment of genital warts. The remainder ($6.6 billion) was for cervical cancer screening and follow-up.
Modeling studies have shown consistently that the routine 
vaccination of 12-year-old girls with either HPV2 or HPV4 is a cost-effective use of public health resources, as long as vaccine duration of protection is sufficient (e.g., 30 years) ( 179,180). 
Estimates of the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by adding HPV vaccination of girls aged 12 years to existing cervical cancer screening programs vary (approximate range: $3,000–$45,000) (181–186).
Although cost-effectiveness estimates for vaccination of girls 
aged 12 years are quite consistent across published models, cost-effectiveness estimates for vaccination of females aged >12 years and for vaccination of males are more uncertain and less precise. The published models generally suggest that the cost-effectiveness of vaccination of females becomes less favorable as the age at vaccination increases beyond the early teenage years.

vaccination decreases. Females who have had HPV testing as part of cervical cancer screening might have information about their HPV status. Males or females with AIN are likely infected with HPV. The presence of anogenital warts or a history of anogenital warts indicates present or past infection with HPV, most often HPV 6 or HPV 11. Although vaccination is still recommended, patients should be advised that vaccination will not have any therapeutic effect on an existing HPV infection, HPV-associated precancer lesion, cancer, or anogenital warts.
Immunocompromised Persons
Persons who are immunocompromised because of transplant, 
medications, or HIV have a higher burden of HPV-associated disease and cancer ( 46). 
Whether there will be any differences in HPV vaccine efficacy between immunocompromised and immunocompetent persons is unclear. ACIP recommends routine vaccination at age 11 or 12 years with HPV2 or HPV4 for females and with HPV4 for males. Vaccination is recommended through age 26 years for immunocompromised persons who have not been vaccinated previously or who have not completed the 3-dose series.
Men Who Have Sex with Men
MSM are at high risk for infection with HPV and associated 
conditions, including anogenital warts and anal cancer ( 29). Sexual abuse and assault raise the risk of HPV infection attributable to the abuse itself, potential future victimization, and subsequent engagement in at-risk behaviors. Children who are victims of sexual abuse or assault are recognized to be more likely to engage in subsequent unsafe and unprotected intercourse and to engage in these behaviors at an earlier age than nonabused children (200).

Monitoring Impact of HPV 
Vaccination in the United States
Most cancers that could be prevented by HPV vaccine occur years 
after infection; therefore, it might be decades before an impact of vaccination is observed on these outcomes. The United States has cancer registries that monitor the incidence of cervical and other HPV-associated cancers ( 203). To determine earlier impact of 
vaccination, several more proximal outcomes are being monitored, including HPV prevalence, genital warts, and cervical precancers (204– 208). ","Recommendations and ReportsMMWR  / August 29, 2014  / Vol . 5 23Vaccination During Pregnancy
